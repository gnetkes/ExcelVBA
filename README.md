Copy and Paste

Theres a "Control" tab in Excel with columb B - being an index 1,2,3...
Column C is the full file path
Column D is the segment name

B2:D31 is the range of the walk file
B34:D63 is the range of the base file

Goal: we are trying to use the template to compare between the walk file vs the base file
We have a "Template" tab that we copy and paste and we labelled the sheets as the index
Everytime we copy and paste, we change cell A1 of the template which all the formula relies on
